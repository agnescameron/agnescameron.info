<h3> #2 INCLUSIVE/EXCLUSIVE DESIGN</H3>    
<h2> addressing marginalisation through technology</h2>
<h2>Speakers TBC</h2>
<p>
This panel examines 'Inclusive Design' as truly inclusionary, looking at how to design for people sidelined, ignored or marginalised by mainstream technological development. This examines design attitudes that not only think about these groups, but also actively involve and encourage their participation in the design process.
