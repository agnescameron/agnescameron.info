<h3> #4  WHY IS MY AI SO RACIST?</H3>    
<h2>algorithmic bias, neural networks and mediated opinion</h2>
<h2>Speakers TBC</h2>
<p>
Artificially intelligent systems - in particular those reliant on deep neural networks - are becoming increasingly woven into our everyday lives, used to predict everything from crime statistics to speech patterns. They're powerful, flexible, fast and developing every day. But they're not without their flaws: from an AI beauty contest that judged white features to be the most attractive, to unintended racial profiling by police camera software, AI prejudices have moved past 'teething problems' and into a unhealthy reflection of existing biases.
