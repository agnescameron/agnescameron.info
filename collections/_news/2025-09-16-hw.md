title: Temporal Landscape @ History Workshop
---

Lola and I wrote an article for [History Workshop](https://www.historyworkshop.org.uk/practice-history/you-will-find-no-direction-here/) about our collaboration on *This is a Temporal Landscape...*, and its inspirations and contexts. Thanks to Vivien Chan for the invitation and the editing!
