I am now officially a [Carpentries Instructor](https://carpentries.org/), and will be organising a [series of workshops](https://iii.pubpub.org/pub/fall-2021-technical) in spring 2022 with KFG (intros to git, the Unix shell, and Python), dates TBC. These are open workshops -- [send me a note](mailto:agnesfcameron@protonmail.com) if you'd be interested in either attending or helping out!
