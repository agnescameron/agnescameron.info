title: More Roar @ Nonclassical
---

Myself and John Richards of the [Dirty Electronics Ensemble](https://www.dirtyelectronics.org/) played a world premiere!! set on the synth we've been making, for the [Nonclassical](https://www.nonclassical.co.uk/) [20th Birthday Party](https://www.nonclassical.co.uk/events/20th-birthday-party) at Two Palms, Hackney. Lots of people told us we should get a chess clock.
