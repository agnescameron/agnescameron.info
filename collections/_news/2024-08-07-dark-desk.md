title: Dark Desk Residency @ Trust
---

Spent the week as resident of [Dark Desk](https://www.are.na/evil-residency/dark-desk), a para-institutional crawlspace. While there, I worked with [Container Technology](https://contain.technology/) to organise the first session of the monthly [Vantage Point Literature Network](https://vantagepoint.literature.network/) (VPN) reading group. If you'd like to attend VPN, drop me an email!
