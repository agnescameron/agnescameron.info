title: Dark Desk Residency @ Trust
---

Spent the week as resident of Dark Desk, a para-institutional crawlspace. While there, I helped organise the first session of the monthly [Vantage Point Literature Network](https://vantagepoint.literature.network/) reading group, in collaboration with [Container Technology](https://contain.technology/). If you'd like to attend VPN, drop me an email!
