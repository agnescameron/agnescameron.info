title: Aesthetics of New AI Interfaces
---

I took part in a [panel discussion](https://www.serpentinegalleries.org/whats-on/aesthetics-of-new-ai-interfaces-panel-discussion/) *Aesthetics of New AI Interfaces* hosted by the Serpentine's Creative AI lab. I wrote some notes on the talk I gave [here](https://soup.agnescameron.info/2021/04/10/terminal-interfaces.html), and there's a write-up of the event [here](https://www.serpentinegalleries.org/art-and-ideas/the-interfaces-of-ai-art-practices/).
