title: Colloquies for Transgenerational Collaboration @ CMU
---
I'm in conversation with [TJ McLeish](https://www.thomasjmcleish.com/) as part of CMU Architecture Department's [symposium](https://soa.cmu.edu/events/2023/10/6/symposium-addressing-wicked-challenges-colloquies-for-transgenerational-collaboration) convening younger and older practitioners around systems principles. We're talking about tools, agency and pedagogy.
