title: Are.na Annual 2022
---

I contributed an essay to the [2022 are.na annual](https://www.are.na/blog/introducing-the-are-na-annual-2022) (theme: portals) about running a category theory reading group, and maths that allows you to re-encounter the world from different vantage points. It was nice to try and synthesise some of the thoughts I'd had about mathematical representation + also to read some really wonderful writing, particularly [this essay](https://people.math.harvard.edu/~mazur/preprints/when_is_one.pdf) by Barry Mazur.
