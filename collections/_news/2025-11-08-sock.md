title: Windsocks @ Our Ponds
---

In <a href="https://inflationaryassets.com/">Inflationary Assets'</a> first official protest outing since <a href="https://agnescameron.info/assets/img/inflatables/kissinger.png">telling Henry Kissenger to fuck off</a>, <a href="https://otherkat.com/">Kat</a> and I made a series of windsocks for a collective performance at <a href="https://www.thepinknews.com/2025/11/06/hampstead-heath-trans-the-dyke-project/">demonstration</a> demanding that the Hampstead Heath Ponds remain trans inclusive. If you haven't already filled out <a href="https://hampstead-heath-bathing-ponds.commonplace.is/">the consultation</a>, please do! It's open until Tuesday November 25th. 
<br><br>
Sock fans will be pleased to know that these were made to (industrial) <a href="https://roctan.com/windsock-information/windsock-measurements/">spec.</a>
