title: Lantern Strike @ 47 Canal
---

I helped artist Cici Wu to prototype a set of lightweight cameras that record shadows in images. Her show, [*Lantern Strike (Strong Loneliness)*](http://47canal.us/exhibitions/cici-wu-lantern-strike-strong-loneliness), which includes the cameras and a film made using them, is on at 47 Canal until July 30th, 2021
