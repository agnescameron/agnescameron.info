title: multispectral satellite imagery
---

The research that I did as a technical writing fellow with Bellingcat, on the journalistic use of geological satellite imaging techniques, has been published! There's a short version on [their website](https://www.bellingcat.com/resources/2025/01/10/satellite-imagery-bands-guide/) and a longer version on [my blog](https://soup.agnescameron.info/2025/01/10/satellite.html). I also made a [tool](https://bellingcat-ee.projects.earthengine.app/view/multispectral-satellite-imagery-explorer)!
