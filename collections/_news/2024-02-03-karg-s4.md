The [Knowledge Arrangement Reading Group](/karg/) is back! We are restarting for 2024 with a session titled *[How much semanticity do we want anyway?](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fXfCHIDHeX1qqdZPSkj2chz0AVdvBR4-46-U87hM0sc/edit)*, discussing mono- and polysemantic representation. We'll be meeting at 4pm GMT on Friday February 9th! (as ever, everyone [is welcome](https://mailman.mit.edu/mailman/listinfo/karg)).
