title: New Sounds @ Orpheus Instituut
---

The [artist statement](https://echo.orpheusinstituut.be/article/new-sounds) I wrote for the Orpheus Instituut's journal [ECHO](https://echo.orpheusinstituut.be/) -- 'Interface After AI' -- was published last week, along with some other really cool essays. I wrote about the idea of 'New Sound', extended technique and tech materiality. Thanks Marek and Roberto for inviting me.
