title: Dark Properties Interview
---

I was [interviewed](https://dark.properties/sensing-the-earth/) by [Meg Miller](https://megmiller.world/) for the [Dark Properties](https://dark.properties) project *Ecologies of Entanglement*, a collaboration with Are.na Editorial. I spoke about satellite images, perspective and expanded modes of vision.
