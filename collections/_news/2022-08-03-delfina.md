title: Resident @ Delfina Foundation

I'm going to be part of the 5th Season of the Delfina Foundation's [Politics of Food](https://www.delfinafoundation.com/programmes/the-politics-of-food/season-5/) programme, as a 'UK Associate' artist, working on a project around food bureacracies + ontologies, trade agreements, and research institutes. I'm planning to write a lot!
