title: Peter and the Wolf and the Hedgehog
---

Myself and Kat Macdonald adapted Sergei Prokofiev's Peter and the Wolf for the [Peckham Chamber Orchestra](https://peckhamchamberorchestra.co.uk/), adding another character (the Hedgehog, played by the More Roar synthesiser), and entirely rewriting the ending. It was my first time conducting, + the hedgehog's concert debut. I wrote more about the project [here](/pwh)
