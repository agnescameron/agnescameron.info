title: Are.na Channel Walkthrough
---

I took part in an [Are.na Channel Walkthrough](https://www.are.na/are-na-team/10-22-are-na-channel-walkthroughs) with Leslie Liu, Maya Man and Maria Gerdyman, in which I talked about collecting [different knowledge organisation systems](https://www.are.na/agnes-cameron/data-food-ontologies) for food. Highlights include volumes [1](https://www.are.na/block/11143252) and [2](https://www.are.na/block/11143253) of *Modifying Food Texture*, this [flavour-space](https://www.are.na/block/1542772) and Patrick Gunkel's [treatise](https://www.are.na/block/10100400) on sausage-forms.
