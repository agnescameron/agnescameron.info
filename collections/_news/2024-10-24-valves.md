title: VALVES @ The White Hotel
---

New music, new performance, new sounds and new synths (using vacuum tubes!) with the [Commission for New and Old Art](https://the-commission.vercel.app/) at the White Hotel in Manchester. Stat magazine wrote about the performance [here](https://statmagazine.org/staging-england/)! (photo: Brad Morgan)
