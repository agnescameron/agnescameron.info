title: Naive Yearly Essay @ are.na editorial
---

The talk I wrote for Naive Yearly was adapted into an essay, with editorial support from the wonderful Meg Miller. It was [published on are.na today](https://www.are.na/editorial/what-can-an-image-do)! It lives in great company with some really beautiful writing from everyone who spoke.
