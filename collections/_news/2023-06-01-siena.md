title: Siena Reading Group @ Moving Castles
---

[GVN](https://twitter.com/GVN908) and I are organising a reading group on Siena as part of [Moving Castles](https://movingcastles.world/) research, exploring how the fabric of the city has been shaped by consecutive games and sets of rules. [Episode 1, *LOTTERIES*](https://discord.gg/SrUrJHvv29?event=1113556845605429368), is this Sunday 4th at 5pm GMT.
