title: RuneScape Economics
---

As part of [Trust's](https://trust.support/) "New Stack" research programme, I am giving a play-through and talk about the economics of the MMORPG [*RuneScape*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RuneScape), exploring the in-game market economy and related effects of scams, bonds, gambling and real-world trading. The talk will be Thursday October 7th at 8pm CEST on the Trust Discord.
