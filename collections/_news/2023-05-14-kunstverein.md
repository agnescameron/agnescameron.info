title: Software for <i>Alien Internet</i> @ Kunstverein Hannover
---

I wrote an agent-based model of animal migration patterns for Agnieszka Kurant's new work, *Alien Internet*, which will be on show in Kunstverein Hannover as part of her exhibition [Uncomputables](https://www.kunstverein-hannover.de/en/ausstellungen/1680-agnieszka-kurant) until July.
