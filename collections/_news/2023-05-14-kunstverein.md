title: Software for *Alien Internet* @ Kunstverein Hanover
---

I wrote an agent-based model of animal migration patterns for Agnieszka Kurant's new work, *Alien Internet*, which will be on show in Kunstverein Hannover as part of her exhibition *[Uncomputables](https://www.kunstverein-hannover.de/en/ausstellungen/1680-agnieszka-kurant)* until July.
