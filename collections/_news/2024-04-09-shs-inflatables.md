First outing of [Inflationary Assets](https://inflationaryassets.com/) tomorrow, running a collaborative inflatable-making workshop as part of the [Morgan Stanley Lates](https://www.somersethouse.org.uk/whats-on/morgan-stanley-lates-somerset-house-courtauld-10-April-24) program. We're making a cylinder! You can help!
