I worked with Lola Olufemi to develop an [archival website](https://thisisatemporallandscape.vercel.app/) based on her PhD research on revolutionary cultural production. The site forms a looping timescape that places legacies of radical organising in the UK in conversation with interviews, sound works, poetry and speculative fiction.

Since the website was published, Lola and I have also developed a lecture performance that presents the site and situates it within our different theoretical contexts. So far, we have delivered this twice -- once as part of the SOAS Department of Gender Studies seminar series, and as the annual lecture for Bristol's Center for Creative Technologies.
