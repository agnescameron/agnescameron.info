description: Project developed for the Innovation Information Initiative to facilitate data sharing
---

I worked with the [Information Innovation Initiative](https://iii.pubpub.org/) (I3) to develop a lightweight collaborative indexing tool that researchers can use to document, share and annotate innovation datasets.

The project started in early 2021 as a [google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bdyhGrj0oNz-_qW3Rv2GNGqhZZ73rgj-DYWePLA_1Ms/edit#gid=1389884911) that was circulated amongst I3 researchers, listing important datasets in the field. Over Summer 2021, I used this sheet to form the basis for the index site, using Github Actions to automatically archive the information in the sheet and create a Jekyll site, with each of the entries getting a separate page. Edits may also be made via pull requests, which are automatically integrated into the site, provided they are valid.

At present, I am developing a more advanced search interface, better metadata indexing, OAI-PMH integration... you can read about future plans [here](https://iii.pubpub.org/pub/iiindex2-0/release/3).

I also released a [forkable version](https://github.com/agnescameron/gh-index-airtable) of this tool that uses Airtable, with instructions to set it up yourself.
