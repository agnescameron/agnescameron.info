description: Project with artists Federico Pérez Villoro and Tiger Dingsun, investigating the Mexican Plataforma Nacional de Transparencia
---

[*Transparencia Index*](https://transparenciaindex.mx/) is a project developed with artist [Federico Pérez Villoro](https://federicoperezvilloro.com/), which indexes entries in the Mexican Freedom of Information archives (Plataforma Nacional de Transparencia) that have been denied as they request classified information.

I worked with Federico on the backend components of the index, building first bots and scrapers to scrape the Plataforma Nacional de Transparencia site, and later on developing a topic model to reveal links between the different entries. The database was realised as a website by [Tiger Dingsun](https://www.tiger.exposed/index), and we presented the project at [Printer Matter](https://www.printedmatter.org/programs/events/1329) in February 2022.
