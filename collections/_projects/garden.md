*Garden of Blues* is a website I made in collaboration with Semine Long and Nancy Valladares, to host their ongoing explorations into fusion cuisine, colonial botany, and the culinary landscape of Cambridge/Somerville MA. The visual form takes inspiration from Islamic garden designs, with flowers in different 'zones' of the gardens leading to different groups of recipes.

We used an airtable as the CMS for the site -- a database construction that threw up a lot of questions about food taxonomy and categorisation, which Semine writes more about [here](https://writing.gardenblues.net/jekyll/update/2020/06/23/recipe-taxonomy.html).

You can access the project [here](https://gardenblues.net/), and we have a shared are.na channel for thoughts and images [here](https://www.are.na/agnes-cameron/proj-garden-of-blues).
