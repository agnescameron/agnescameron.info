description: Foreign Objects project for the Mozilla Foundation, exploring AI chatbots that mimick people
---

*Bot or Not?* is a project developed by Foreign Objects, for the Mozilla Foundation Creative Media Awards. The project -- consisting of an online game and learning resource, and accompanying workshop *Bot Chat* -- explores questions around embodiment, agency and labour brought about by the increasing ease with which anyone can make a moderately-convincing 'human' agent. I wrote [here](https://soup.agnescameron.info/2020/05/29/cheap-ai.html) about the process of designing the 'AI' part of the game.

The game itself can be played [here](https://botor.no/), and the accompanying guide we wrote -- covering questions about the legal status of bots, their history, and how to identify them -- is available [here](https://about.botor.no/).
