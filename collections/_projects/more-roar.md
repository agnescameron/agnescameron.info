I worked with John Richards (aka Dirty Electronics Ensemble) to develop an *entropic synthesiser and degenerative artwork*. MORE ROAR is an FM synthesiser built around a STM32 microcontroller that degrades sounds as you play. It exists in many forms, including a DIY nails-based design, and an 'official' PCB version, designed by Tellamont, that you can order through [our website](https://moreroar.org).

The synth was developed over the course of a number of workshops and performances. We launched the 'official' version with a party at Avalon Cafe on May 15th. The project is open-source -- the code and hardware schematics can be found [here](https://github.com/agnescameron/MORE_ROAR).
