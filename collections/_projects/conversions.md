*Conversions* is the current iteration of an ongoing collaboration with the artist Agnieszka Kurant, which was exhibited at Science Gallery London in summer 2019, as part of the Dark Matters exhibition.

I wrote the software backend for this piece, which takes scraped twitter affect data and uses it to feed a simulated society, whose economic health (or lack thereof) is translated into a series of scales, which then power a liquid crystal display that morphs and changes over time. The code for this work is available [here](https://github.com/agnescameron/social-sugarscape)

An earlier iteration of this project, *Animal Internet*, which featured (amongst other things) a tank full of artificial hamsters, features in [Issue 8 of SFMOMA's Open Space](https://openspace.sfmoma.org/2018/03/assembly-line-animal-internet/).
