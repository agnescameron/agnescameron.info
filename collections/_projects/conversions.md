*Conversions* is the current iteration of an ongoing collaboration with the artist Agnieszka Kurant, which was exhibited at Science Gallery London in summer 2019, as part of the Dark Matters exhibition, and has since been shown at the DeYoung Museum, the Istanbul Biennial. 

Together with [Owen Trueblood](https://owentrueblood.com/), I wrote the software backend for this piece, which takes scraped twitter affect data and uses it to feed a simulated society, whose economic health (or lack thereof) is translated into a series of scales, which then power a liquid crystal display that morphs and changes over time. The code for this work is available [here](https://github.com/agnescameron/social-sugarscape). The hardware component of this piece was made by [Fifth Class Designs](https://www.fifthclassdesigns.com/conversions) and [Material Evolution Lab](materialevolutionlab.com).

An earlier iteration of this project, *Animal Internet*, which featured (amongst other things) a tank full of artificial hamsters, features in [Issue 8 of SFMOMA's Open Space](https://openspace.sfmoma.org/2018/03/assembly-line-animal-internet/).
