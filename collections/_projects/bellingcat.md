I was a 2024 Bellingcat Technical Writing Fellow, where I developed a [guide](https://www.bellingcat.com/resources/2025/01/10/satellite-imagery-bands-guide/) to using multispectral satellite imagery, and a [tool](https://bellingcat-ee.projects.earthengine.app/view/multispectral-satellite-imagery-explorer) that demonstrates these techniques. The guide uses a case study of bauxite mining to translate research from the geological and environmental sciences into a journalistic context.

In addition to the guide published by Bellingcat, I wrote a longer and more thorough guide which may be found on [my blog](https://soup.agnescameron.info/2025/01/10/satellite.html). I'm actively interested in carrying out more satellite imaging research based on this work, and applying it to other forms of investigation.
