*The First 10,000 Years* is a collaboration with [Gary Zhexi Zhang](https://zhexi.info), as part of his ongoing project *FUD*. It simulates a catastrophe insurance trading market, where a group of players trade bonds on the outcome of different hurricanes.

The hurricanes in question are modelled -- in the style of a 10,000 year model, where projections for the year are made based on 10,000 simulations -- on the [HURDAT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HURDAT) dataset, perturbed randomly each time the market runs.

You can access the project live [here](https://fud.global/).
