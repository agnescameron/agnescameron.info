[Gary](https://zhexi.info) and I made *Permaculture Network* as part of a [Schloss Solitude Web Residency](https://schloss-post.com/category/web-residents/rigged-systems/) while at [Sakiya](https://sakiya.org/), Palestine, in the Summer of 2019. It explores the ecology of Sakiya's site and permaculture farm as an ecological conversation, based on Omar Tesdell's (as Makaneyyat) agro-ecological survey of the site. The piece takes inspiration from agent-based games like Dwarf Fortress, where every element of the game acts as an individual agent.

I wrote about the process of making the simulation [here](https://soup.agnescameron.info/2020/05/27/permaculture-writeup.html), and we gave an interview about the work [here](https://schloss-post.com/flora-fauna-and-folk-tales/). There is an are.na channel that charts the research and development of the project [here](https://www.are.na/agnes-cameron/permaculture-network).

It has since featured in the exhibition [Our Loves are not Only Human](https://schloss-post.com/our-loves-are-not-only-human/) at Schloss Solitude, and in Daphne Dragona's [publication](https://networkcultures.org/blog/publication/the-eternal-network/) for Transmediale 2020.

You can access the work online [here](root.schloss-post.com/).
