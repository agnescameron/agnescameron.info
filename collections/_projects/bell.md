As Foreign Objects, + in collaboration with Eliza Collin (garment production) and Genie Kausto (styling and photography), I helped to research, design and fabricate a set of 5 embroidered jumpsuits based around the archives of the Computing Sciences Research Center at Bell Labs. This project was part of a program called [Further Experiments in Art and Technology](https://furtherexperiments.rhizome.org/), a collaboration between [Rhizome](https://rhizome.org/) and [Nokia Bell Labs](https://www.bell-labs.com/).

I wrote in more detail about this project [here](https://soup.agnescameron.info/2021/03/21/bell-system.html), and the research for this project is located [here](https://www.are.na/foreign-objects/an-introduction-to-the-bell-system). I also 'designed' the [site](1127.foreignobjects.net/) for the project, which is just a folder full of images hosted over Apache.
