title: crispy tofu mushroom
---

toss tofu cubes in potato starch and salt and fry in a hot hot wok. didn't need so much oil, just a little bit at the bottom. extract cubes when crispy and set aside. fry ginger garlic spring onion in remaining oil (pour some out if it's lots). add enokis, fry for a few seconds, then add soy sauce and a little sesame oil. put the tofu back in and fry for another 20 secs, eat with rice.
