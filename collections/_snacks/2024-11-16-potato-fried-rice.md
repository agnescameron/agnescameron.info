title: potato fried rice
---

made a lovely fried rice dish using leftover cubes of boiled potato. fried off roughly cut green chilli and garlic, then added the potato cubes and some beansprouts. Added rice and a small amount of soy and black pepper, then an egg. 

served with spinach ohitashi and fried salmon. would have benefitted greatly from the presence of pickles.
