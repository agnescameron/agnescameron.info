title: karaoke mussel tofu
---

having learned that it's possible to bring your own food to karaoke at the Walthamstow Trades Hall, I made a packed dinner of japchae, a quick radish kimchi, and an improvised dish based on korean braised tofu.

* fry tofu chunks, adding thick cut lengths of spring onion and slices of ginger
* once crisp on both sides, add in squashed garlic cloves
* mix a small bowl of seaweed, boiling water and dashi (I used clam dashi), pour this over the tofu
* simmer, then add a handful of frozen mussels
* add soy and salt to taste
