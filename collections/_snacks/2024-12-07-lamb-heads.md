title: roast lamb's heads
---

I roasted 2 lamb's heads for my birthday, according to the method laid out by inimitable Serious Eats offal columnist [Chichi Wang](https://www.seriouseats.com/the-nasty-bits-lambs-head). Surprisingly straightforward, cheap and totally delicious, would definitely do again.
