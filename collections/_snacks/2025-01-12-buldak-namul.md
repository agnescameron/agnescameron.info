title: bad buldak good namul
---

due to the extreme cold weather, i finally tried the [buldak carbonara noodles](https://starrymart.co.uk/samyang-buldak-hot-chicken-flavour-ramen-creamy-carbonara-140g-pack-of-5.html) that I had in the cupboard. Inspired by reading the wikipedia page for [namul](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Namul), I blanched some lettuce leaves and mixed them with soy sesame oil garlic and sugar as a side dish. I also had a little plate of the christmas radish kimchi.

the noodles had a good texture and the flavour was fine, but could not get over the sweet cheesy milk powder smell, very cloying! the lettuce namul was delicious.
