Along with Kevin MacDonald and SJ Klein, I've been organising a [series of technical workshops](https://iii.pubpub.org/pub/fall-2021-technical) for the [Innovation Information Initiative](https://iii.pubpub.org) extended community, based on the [Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/) workshop format. These workshops are open to anyone and require no prior knowledge of the topics covered, [send me a note](mailto:agnesfcameron@protonmail.com) if you'd be interested in either attending or helping out!
