In summer 2018 i taught a 2-hour workshop class that gave people a working understanding of (and set of resources to practically implement) blockchains, with an emphasis on ethereum and different consensus models.

The site I made for the class is available [here](https://agnescameron.github.io/how-to-blockchain-almost-anything/index.html), though the resources on it will likely be fairly outdated by now.
