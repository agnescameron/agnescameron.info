I wrote an introductory workshop on making generative embroidery designs using [PEmbroider](https://github.com/CreativeInquiry/PEmbroider), the [Studio for Creative Enquiry](https://studioforcreativeinquiry.org/)'s Processing-based embroidery software, intended for students who are just starting to learn Processing. I'm planning to write a follow-up version for more experienced students using images, data imports, API calls and mouse events.
