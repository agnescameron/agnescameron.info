Myself and CBA workshop manager Tom Lutz co-taught the 2018 textiles recitation for How to Make Almost Anything, covering the basics of machine sewing, inflatables, digital embroidery and knitting. The site for the class is online [here](https://fab.cba.mit.edu/classes/863.18/doc/sewing.html), and our slides are available [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1U5vzK0wHKXBZkMXNf1vDIRxCSbC2AxnJvcb6qFlc1mo/edit).

This class also resulted in the development of the 'PE Design 6' meme, a homage to mine and Tom's favourite piece of CAD software.
