Since Autumn 2023, I have been co-ordinating the Creative Computing Institute's [Technical Skills Workshops](https://wiki.cci.arts.ac.uk/books/technical-skills-workshops), where different members of the CCI's technical team share practical technical skills to complement and extend what students are covering in class. 

These take inspiration from the [Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/) workshop format and philosophy, and some directly from their teaching materials. There have been workshops on a wide range of topics so far, including efficient 3D printing, Blender, command line programming, electronics fabrication and git.

I also designed the stickers :)
