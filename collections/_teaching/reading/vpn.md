I run the [Vantage Point Literature Network](https://vantagepoint.literature.network/) (VPN) in collaboration with [Container Technology](https://contain.technology/). It is hosted monthly on the [Trust discord](https://trust.support/), though our first session was hosted in person and involved free herring.

VPN meets to look into, around and beyond the political possibilities of technology. We contend that a point of view is what allows us to move through the world, to have direction, to act with imagination. 

A point of view is both not enough -- fragile, and ephemeral -- and the core of political demands and the articulation of collective desires. Here at VPN, we wish to bend our point of view in the direction of:

* new and old technologies -- new technologies for old ideas, old technologies for new ones
* polymorphous visions of the past, present and future
* radical archival projects, shadow libraries, and collective knowledge

We read a mixture of theory and practice, and take the technical aspects of what we do very seriously. We hold with equal seriousness the conviction that technical knowledge is for everyone, and work together to create an environment that realises this commitment.
