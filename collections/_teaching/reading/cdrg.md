The Circuit Diagram Reading Group (CDRG) is a co-learning project developed with [Murad Khan](https://maps.app.goo.gl/YXsNEC2QgVZMRnt6A) at the Creative Computing Institute. Attendees meet monthly to build a synthesiser circuit from scratch, and discuss the 'new sound' that the circuit brought to the world when it was first designed, and who was using those sounds. This group will meet in person at [Camberwell College of Art](https://maps.app.goo.gl/YXsNEC2QgVZMRnt6A) on Monday evenings once a month.

We plan to begin the group officially in October 2024. For a sense of what we are thinking of making / reading / listening to, we have an [are.na channel](https://www.are.na/agnes-cameron/proj-circuit-diagram-reading-group). If you are interested in joining, please [send me a note](mailto:a.cameron@arts.ac.uk).
