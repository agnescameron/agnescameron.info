*CATRG* (Category Theory Reading Group) was a group of non-mathematicians slowly working their way through the book [*Seven Sketches In Compositionality*](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.05316), by Brendan Fong and David Spivak, that ran weekly online in Spring/Summer 2021.

We made an [are.na channel](https://www.are.na/agnes-cameron/catrg) of related resources, a [Miro Board](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_lYHZnX4=/) of collaborative notes. The archived administration page for the mailing list is [here](http://mailman.mit.edu/mailman/listinfo/catrg).
