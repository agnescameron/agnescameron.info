*CATRG* (Category Theory Reading Group) is a group of non-mathematicians slowly working their way through the book [*Seven Sketches In Compositionality*](), by David Spivak and Brendan Fong.

We maintain an [are.na channel](https://www.are.na/agnes-cameron/catrg) of related resources, a [Miro Board](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_lYHZnX4=/) of collaborative notes, and have an intention to migrate our learnings to expand the English-language Simple Wikipedia resources on category theory and related topics.

If you'd like to join, the administration page for the mailing list is [here](http://mailman.mit.edu/mailman/listinfo/catrg); feel free to also [send me a note](mailto:agnescam@mit.edu) to get the current chapter and details of the next meeting.
