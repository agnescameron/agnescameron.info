*ARRG* (the Agrarianism and Revolution Reading Group) met to discuss radical movements, ideas and materials concerning land and food. It was started by myself and artist Ã…sa Sonjasdottir in September 2022, as part of our participation in the Delfina Foundation's *Politics of Food* programme.

During the residency, we hosted a public session of the group, where we read [extracts](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oNgzUjutr89nlHAIw9cVgY69Y9DheJiAVmxg084NsWI/edit) from a number of different texts from the duration of the group, and for which I cooked a menu of traditional Armenian dishes*.

I wrote an overview of what we read and discussed, which may be found [on my blog](https://soup.agnescameron.info//2023/01/08/arrg.html). Notes and readings from past sessions may be found in this [google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kZ0qLvmJgfvJ6jN8SSwNWMlcbrEOX7vNFZBx3yVDuwY/edit#), and this [are.na channel](https://www.are.na/agnes-cameron/arrg-meovcqgdmcu) contains a set of past and possible readings.

ARRG is not currently active, though there is a notion that we might reconvene in the future. If you'd like to our mailing list, you can do so [here](https://mailman.mit.edu/mailman/listinfo/arrg); feel free to also [send me a note](mailto:agnescam@mit.edu) to get the current vibe.
