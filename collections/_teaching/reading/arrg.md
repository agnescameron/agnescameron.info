*ARRG* (the Agrarianism and Revolution Reading Group) is group meets to discuss radical movements, ideas and materials concerning land and food. It was started by myself and artist Ã…sa Sonjasdottir in September 2022, as part of our participation in the Delfina Founsation *Politics of Food* programme.

Notes and readings from past sessions may be found in this [google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kZ0qLvmJgfvJ6jN8SSwNWMlcbrEOX7vNFZBx3yVDuwY/edit#), and this [are.na channel](https://www.are.na/agnes-cameron/arrg-meovcqgdmcu) contains a set of past and possible readings.
