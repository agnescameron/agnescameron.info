The Knit Tech Reading Group (KTRG) is part of the [Material Programming Research Project](https://cci.arts.ac.uk/~material), a collaboration between researchers at UAL's Creative Computing Institute and Smart Textiles Lab. The group convenes to think around the following questions:

* what are the idiosyncrasies of knit as a medium? why is knitting *like that*?
* when designing tools for the creation of knit textiles, what kinds of task and operation have been under-considered?
* how do we evaluate the *quality* (in terms of craftsmanship, design, ease of use) of new advances in knit technology?
* how can software tools (made using code) work with and for experienced knitters? how can or should they work for people with no knit experience?

We meet monthly. Each session, we pre-read and discuss two readings (normally research papers), both relating to a particular theme within knitting and technology. A document of past and future readings is available [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PbvUizLxAIzriJ6Pm5sGWxRACFEXZ7zO0eekR8m_dmU/edit). You can sign up to the mailing list [here](https://mailman.mit.edu/mailman/listinfo/knit-tech).
