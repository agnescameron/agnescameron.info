*KARG* (Knowledge Arrangement Reading Group) is facilitated by myself and (historically) [SJ Klein](http://blogs.harvard.edu/sj/). Together, we explore different ways to structure, aggregate, transform and link knowledge. It was established in June 2021, and has run in seasons of a few months at a time since.

The format is fairly casual, and we meet approximately once every 2 weeks. We normally contact the authors of what we are reading and invite them to join -- some of KARG's longest-running members joined in this way. We welcome new members, including for one-off sessions.

A document containing links to notes and possible readings is maintained [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fXfCHIDHeX1qqdZPSkj2chz0AVdvBR4-46-U87hM0sc/edit), and the administration page (if you're interested in subscribing, you should!) is [here](https://mailman.mit.edu/mailman/listinfo/karg).

*KARG is running again for Autumn 2024! join us!*
