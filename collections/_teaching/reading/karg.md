*KARG* (Knowledge Arrangement Reading Group) is facilitated by myself and [SJ Klein](http://blogs.harvard.edu/sj/), that explores different ways to structure, aggregate, transform and link knowledge, established June 2021.

A document containing links to notes and possible readings is maintained [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fXfCHIDHeX1qqdZPSkj2chz0AVdvBR4-46-U87hM0sc/edit), and the administration page (if you're interested in subscribing, you should!) is [here](https://mailman.mit.edu/mailman/listinfo/karg).
