In Spring 2020, myself and [Gary Zhexi Zhang](https://zhexi.info) co-taught a class in Web Development at Parsons School of Design. The class introduced basic web programming skills, and culminated in the development of an archive.

Thanks to [Cab Broskoski](http://www.charlesbroskoski.com/_/) of [are.na](https://are.na) for being the visting critic in our final class.

The website for the class is archived [here](https://webdevelopm.net/parsons/index.html).
