In Autumn 2019, I worked as a studio assistant at the MIT Museum Studio, for the final 2 weeks' of Seth Riskin and Sarah Schwettman's class [Vision in Art and Neuroscience](http://vision.mit.edu/), helping students to design and develop projects for an exhibition at MIT's Compton Gallery.

The final show -- Instruments of Vision -- ran from December 2019-May 2020.
