At the inspection line \
I am tasked with analysis of \
Abrasion resistance.
It's a privilege to inspect your \
work. I always think \
Your attention to detail \
Ensures the precise lubricity \
Of our entire range of scientific glassware.

At the inspection line \
I steal a glance toward \
the Hot End \
I want to look at your \
forming machines. quad gob. \
IS model. multi section. 3.2 bar. \
The moulds open and close \
You are mouthing detailed instructions.

At the inspection line \
I think about how what \
Sits so hard and still in front of me \
Was not long ago just putty \
Lightly held in your \
tongs. How soft and hot and \
Powerful you must be to work in this way

At the inspection line \
I watch them measure out \
Clouds of silver dust \
Old rocks becoming new \
I think about \
-- you \
-- your machines \
-- the sighing of the air compressor \
-- best practices for particulate extraction, a key challenge in this industry
