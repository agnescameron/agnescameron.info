It was a few weeks after I’d moved to Basra that the visions started in earnest. Initially I would get them while working. I would notice a strange, slippery feeling and a shimmering at the edge of my vision as reality started to fray. I was unsettled by them.

My work was important but tedious. I had to inspect the maps and make calculations. When I was finished, I would draw lines on the charts and give them to the engineers. 

Every few weeks I would go out into the desert to see one of the lines I had drawn, turned into a deep hole in the ground. Sometimes by the time I arrived the men would already have hooked up all the machinery, pumping vast volumes of black, sticky oil from deep inside the rock. At other times they would still be drilling. I never quite knew why I was there. Sometimes they would ask me questions. At other times we would stand there in silence, before driving back to the compound. 

After a month or so the visions started to include voices. It took some time for me to understand them, but it seemed like they had something important to say.

"We have invented a new method of drawing" they said. "It has taken us a very long time. It is important. We would like you to understand it"

When I heard the voices I would feel in my body that I was the desert. I would feel all of the drills at once, boring into me. If I held very still I could sometimes see the drawings that the voices were referring to.

I would wake from the visions at my desk in the office. New lines would have appeared on the map. One day, I forgot to erase these lines. The holes that were drilled from them were startlingly productive. Shortly afterward I was promoted. I decided to extend my contract in Basra. 

At around the time of my promotion, the visions started to feature in my dreams. At night the voices were quite different. They were more conversational. I heard about their lives and about how many of them were ghosts.

In the dreams I was not the desert, but a drill, boring very deep into the ground. 

I knew that when I was the drill I was trying to find the voices. They were very old. Every morning when I woke I would make a note of the geological conditions where I had been drilling. Each night the tip of the drill was deeper and deeper, going further back in time.

I reached the voices around the Upper Cretaceous period. They were also drills and we bored together for a time, deeper and deeper into the ground. As well as being ghosts, they were pieces of complex machinery. They told me how all the machines in the oil field contained men’s souls. The drawing, they said, was a way that they would become free.

By the time I left Basra the voices had become more numerous and insistent. The ground of the oil field resembled a sponge, littered with hundreds of strange, yawing machines, that were also men. I didn’t understand what the voices wanted me to do. I became frustrated with them. 

On my last day I drove out of the compound by myself to the very center of the field. I could hear them all, talking about the drawing. I thought about what would happen if I joined them, deep in the ground.

On the flight home I clutched a letter from my wife very tightly.
