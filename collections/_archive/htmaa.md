In Autumn 2017, I took the class [*How To Make Almost Anything*](http://fab.cba.mit.edu/classes/863.17/), and made a bunch of silly things, including a small swarm of [Braitenberg Vehicles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braitenberg_vehicle). A website documenting what I made over the term is [here](http://fab.cba.mit.edu/classes/863.17/CBA/people/agnes/index.html).
