I learned how to use a digital embroidery machine a couple of years ago, and thought it would be nice to keep an archive of my experiments. Currently I'm the proud owner of a Brother Innovis NV800-E, a domestic machine (on which I did all the embroidery for [the Bell Labs project](/bell)), and use a combination of PE Design 6 and PEMbroider software (a process that I wrote about [here](https://soup.agnescameron.info/2021/03/21/bell-system.html)).
