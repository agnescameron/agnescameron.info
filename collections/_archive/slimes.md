My 4th-year dissertation at Cambridge (supervised by [Fumiya Iida](http://mi.eng.cam.ac.uk/Main/FI224) of the [Bio Inspired Robotics Laboratory](https://birlab.org/)) examined the use of slime mould *Physarum Polycephalum* as a bio-inspired model for a fault tolerant network.

My research involved the construction of cellular automata models that were then used for a series of experiments, examining the mediation of information flow over the distributed network. I also grew some live slimes to validate the efficacy of my model. 

The code for this project is available [here](https://github.com/agnescameron/slime-moulds), and a copy of the dissertation itself is available [here](/assets/pdfs/physarum_self_org.pdf).
