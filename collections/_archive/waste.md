> *Treating waste as information means following the heterogeneous network of connections in which a piece of garbage is embedded.* -- Dietmar Offenhuber

Let's Play: Waste at MIT is a simulation game I developed as part of my thesis project at the MIT Media Lab, in partnership with the Office for Recycling and Materials Management, and as part of a sustianability initiative within the lab. 

In the game, you play the role of the head of the office for recycling, where you have to try and maintain the quality of waste streams, while also managing the welfare of your staff, communicating with students, and staying within the allocated budget.

You can play the game [here](https://wasteatmit.netlify.app). My thesis is available [here](/assets/pdfs/waste_at_mit.pdf).
