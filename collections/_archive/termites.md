For a class in Biomimetic Engineering, I examined the use of termite-inspired construction models for use in urban planning. I simulated a number of 'mounds' generated by different groups of termites and under different conditions, measuring the walkability of different densities and layouts, and rendered the resultant street plans in some very sketchy Sketchup models. The project drew a lot of inspiration from decentralised / agent-based models of co-operation, and architectural cybernetics.
