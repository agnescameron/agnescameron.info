While at Cambridge, I was the designer's representative at the ADC theatre, and led costume teams for the opera society and various stage shows. Below are some highlights:

## SiX: The Musical, 2017

I was the costume designer for the first run of Toby Marlow and Lucy Moss' *SIX: The Musical*, a show that follows the stories of the 6 wives of Henry VIII in the form of a pop concert. This show has gone on to become [ludicrously famous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_(musical)).

The design concept was essentially 'BooHoo but with ruffs', with a combination of handmade and purchased costumes.

## Kepler's Trial, 2017

I was comissioned to design and make the costumes for the world premiere of [Kepler's Trial](http://www.keplers-trial.com/), a new opera that was performed in King's College Chapel, written by Tim Watts and directed by William Ashford. Based on the book *The Astronomer and the Witch* by Ulinka Rublack, the opera follows Keplers' mothers' accusation of witchcraft.

The costumes drew on a combination of modern and medieval designs, incorporating astronomic symbols, and were handmade from felt.

## The Rake's Progress, 2017

Opera directed by William Ashford, for Cambridge University Opera Society. The chorus costumes involved the slow addition of pastel-coloured stuffed limbs, an effect which also resulted in my room being filled with a huge amount of stuffing (20kg is more stuffing than anyone needs). I worked with Alice Brightman.

## Eugene Onegin, 2016

Tchaikovsky opera directed by Robert Hawkins, for Cambridge University Opera Society. It was set in 1920's russia: the costumes drew inspiration from the paintings of Rodckenko, Malevich and Stepanova, and the ballet *Victory over the Sun*. I worked with Alice Brightman, India Ayles and Amy Murgatroyd.
