Project with [Gary Zhexi Zhang](https://zhexi.info), funded by the [Council for the Arts at MIT](https://arts.mit.edu/camit/about/). We placed a series of inflatable sculptures around MIT's campus, in a tribute to the architectural interventions of CAVS artist Jonathan Goldman, in particular his work [*Nudibranch*](http://act.mit.edu/cavs/group/fc332058-52bd-425c-aa6a-76225626ec7c), which we first stumbled upon at the opening night of the [CAVS archival website](http://act.mit.edu/cavs/).

This project inspired us to run a number of different inflatable-making workshops, which are documented [here](/inflatables).
