I helped to organise the 2019 Festival of Learning at the [MIT Media Lab](https://www.media.mit.edu/) -- a student-organised day in January when students, staff and faculty run workshops for one another, culminating in a shared meal and a party.

For the 2020 edition, I was invited back to do the graphic design a second time. Each session in both years got a representative blob, with the 2019 and 2020 posters, and some sample blobs included below.
