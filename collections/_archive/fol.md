I helped to organise the 2019 Festival of Learning at the [MIT Media Lab](https://www.media.mit.edu/) -- a student-organised day in January when students, staff and faculty run workshops for one another, culminating in a shared meal and a party. 

One of my main contributions to the organising was the graphic design, and I have since been invited back to this twice -- for the 2020 and 2022 editions -- with the 2022 designs made in collaboration with graphic designer Helen Gao. Each session in both years got a representative blob (I think), and some sample blobs are included below, along with the posters for each year.
