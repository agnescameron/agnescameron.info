As well as making theatre costumes, I have a large archive of different costumes and installations made for parties. I've got particularly interested in larger sculptural forms in the past couple of years.

### the beast with 7 heads from the book of revelation, winter 2025

This one was a really interesting process, and one of my more successful sculptural costumes. If I were to do this again I'd choose a different order 

### large insect, summer 2024

Very inspired by this image. Enjoyed using the structure of plastic items found in hardware store.

### black hole, summer 2023

this was not my best work -- the idea was to make a kind of Rei Kawakubo style jacket based on the image of the black hole, using large felt elements. In the end I was working too large, and the neoprene I selected for the main body was floppy at scale. A woman in the pub where I got changed asked if I was a pizza.

### the seasons, summer 2022

For this I made a simple A-line dress, onto which I stitched laurel leaves from the back garden, using a zig zag stitch so as not to just slice the leaves in half. This worked pretty well, and these held up okay for the first part of the night, but by the end my friends' house was covered in crunchy leaves that had flaked off the lower layers of the dress.



### nudibranch, winter 2019

This costume was really inspired by Sandra Leonard's soft sculpture costumes for children. It was made quite quickly, and without stuffing for the spines!
