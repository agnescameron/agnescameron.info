Mine is a dizzying country in which the Lottery is a major element of reality. \\
-- Jorge Luis Borges, The Lottery in Babylon

...one of the most insidious of the "hidden injuries of class" in North American society was the denial of the right to do good, to be noble, to pursue any form of value other than money – or, at least, to do it and to gain any financial security or rewards for having done. The passionate hatred of the "liberal elite" among right-wing populists came down, in practice, to the utterly justified resentment towards a class that had sequestered, for its own children, every opportunity to pursue love, truth, beauty, honor, decency, and to be afforded the means to exist while doing so. The endless identification with soldiers ("support our troops!") – that is, with individuals who have, over the years, been reduced to little more than high tech mercenaries enforcing a global regime of financial capital – lay in the fact that these are almost the only individuals of working class origin in the US who have figured out a way to get paid for pursuing some kind of higher ideal, or at least being able to imagine that's what they’re doing. Obviously most would prefer to pursue higher ideals in way that did not involve the risk of having their legs blown off. The sense of rage, in fact, stems above all from the knowledge that all such jobs are taken by children of the rich. It’s a strangely ambivalent picture, and one that, at this moment of revival of right-wing populism, we might do well to consider once again. \\

Intuition at first suggests that there is a crucial difference between the (metamathematical) result about the nonformalizability of truth and the (metaphorical) claim about the nonmechanizability of semantic categories; this difference would be that the set of all truths in a mathematical domain such as set theory or number theory is objective and eternal, whereas the set of all "A" 'sis subjective and ephemeral. However, on closer examination, this distinction begins to blur quite a bit [...] Just as one can find all sorts of borderline examples of "A"-ness, examples that make one sense the hopelessness of trying to draw the concept's exact boundaries, so one can find all sorts of borderline mathematical statements that are formally undecidable in standard systems and which, even to a keen mathematical intuition, hover between truth and falsity. [...] Thus, somewhat counterintuitively, it turns out that mathematical truth has no fixed and eternal boundaries, either.
-- Douglas Hofstader, Meta-Font and Metaphysics
