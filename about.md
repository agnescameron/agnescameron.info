I design and build software and hardware, sometimes alone but often [with friends](https://www.foreignobjects.net/). I have a particular interest in simulations, distributed knowledge and non-human forms of intelligence and communication. Currently, I work with the Knowledge Futures Group, developing tools for open data curation and sharing as part of the Underlay project, and I am a resident artist at Somerset House Studios.

If you are an activist group or community organisation looking for technical support, I'm normally happy to volunteer my time. You can get in touch with me at: agnesfcameron at protonmail dot com.
