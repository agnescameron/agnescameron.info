<p>Hi, I'm Agnes <a onmouseenter="showPostImage('/assets/img/main/cat.png')" onmouseleave="hidePostImage()" href="#" style="text-decoration: none; color: black;">‚Üù</a></p>

<p>I design, build and maintain software and hardware, sometimes alone but often with friends. I have a particular interest in simulation, distributed knowledge and infrastructural systems. Currently, I work on <a href="https://iiindex.org/">tools</a> for open data curation and sharing, I am a part time specialist technician and lecturer at UAL's <a href="https://www.arts.ac.uk/creative-computing-institute">Creative Computing Institute</a>, and 25% of the research studio <a href="https://www.foreignobjects.net/">Foreign Objects</a>.</p>

<p>If you are an activist group or community organisation looking for technical support or advice, I'm normally happy to volunteer my time. I also like hearing from people generally. You can get in touch with me at: agnesfcameron at protonmail dot com.</p>
