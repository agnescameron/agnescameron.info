<p>I design, build and maintain software and hardware, sometimes alone but often with <a href="/webring">friends</a>. I have a particular interest in collective knowledge and infrastructural systems. At present, these interests are directed toward independent collaborative research work with <a href="/bellingcat">satellite imagery</a>, <a href="/temporal-landscape">new archives</a>, and <a href="https://soup.agnescameron.info//2025/01/05/synths.html">new sonic hardware.</a></p>

<p>I am a specialist technician and lecturer at UAL's <a href="https://www.arts.ac.uk/creative-computing-institute">Creative Computing Institute</a>, and director of the community interest company <a href="https://inflationaryassets.com/">Inflationary Assets</a>. I was a <a href="https://www.bellingcat.com/resources/2025/01/10/satellite-imagery-bands-guide/">2024 Bellingcat Tech Fellow</a>; previous affiliations include the <a href="https://www.mozillafoundation.org/en/blog/getting-know-foreign-objects-creators-bot-or-not/">Mozilla Foundation</a>, <a href="https://www.newmuseum.org/new-inc/members-alumni/?page=1&year=year-eleven">New INC</a>, <a href="https://www.somersethouse.org.uk/residents/agnes-cameron">Somerset House Studios</a>, <a href="https://www.knowledgefutures.org/">Knowledge Futures Group</a>, <a href="https://mitmuseum.mit.edu/more/mit-museum-studio-and-compton-gallery">MIT Museum Studio</a> and <a href="https://www.media.mit.edu/people/agnescam/overview/">MIT Media Lab</a>. I was a founding member of the research studio <a href="https://www.foreignobjects.net/">Foreign Objects</a>, and often collaborate with the game designers <a href="https://movingcastles.world/">Moving Castles</a>.
