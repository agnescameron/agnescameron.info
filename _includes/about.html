<p>I design, build and maintain software and hardware, sometimes alone but often with <a href="/webring">friends</a>. I have a particular interest in simulation, collective knowledge and infrastructural systems.</p>

I was a founding member of the research studio <a href="https://www.foreignobjects.net/">Foreign Objects</a>, am a sometime collaborator of the game studio <a href="https://movingcastles.world/">Moving Castles</a>, and I edit Wikipedia under the alias <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Petsquirrel">Petsquirrel</a>.</p>
