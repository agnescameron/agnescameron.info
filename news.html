<h1>News</h1>

<p>NB: have only been regularly updating this page since 2021 (though I added some links for posterity), so it's not a very reliable archive.</p>

<div id="news">
	{% for post in site.news reversed %}
		{{ post.date | date: "%d/%m/%Y" }} ↝ <b>{{ post.title }}</b> ↝ {{ post.content }}<br>
	{% endfor %}
</div>
