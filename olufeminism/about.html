Hi, I'm Lola, a third year English Student at Selwyn College and I'm running to be the next CUSU Women's Officer. In my first year, the women's campaign was a place I sought refuge from racialised misogyny: it provided support, creative outlets and a place to express my frustration about the sexism that me and other women and non-binary students faced during our studies. There is a culture of silence around these issues; sexism is often dismissed, we're told it's all in our heads or that "we've come a long way and shouldn't complain." We're made to feel at fault for a widespread institutional problem. I got involved in the Women's Campaign because I wanted to help end that culture of silence and create spaces that centered the voices of the most marginalized women and non-binary students.<br><br>One thing crucial to the role of women's officer is institutional memory. I've watched as students tirelessly campaigned for the establishment of consent workshops and collected data about sexual harassment, I've hosted panels about the need to address institutional sexism and highlighted the creative work of women and femmes in the Women's Campaigns termly zine. I want a chance to continue this incredible work. I want a chance to lead an effective political Campaign that supports women and non-binary students when they need it most. I have been involved in student activism throughout my time at Cambridge and have constantly engaged with the need to protect and promote our safety and wellbeing. I've run workshops and written extensively about intersectionality, protested against violence of campus by attending Reclaim the Night every year and have a deep vested interested in seeing women and non-binary students be given a space to exist free from institutional oppression. <br><br>If elected, I would aim to:<br><br>
<div class="linksabout">
   Create a strong and wide-reaching campaign, one that doesn't sugarcoat its aims and objectives
   <br><br>Work on making the Women's Campaign a place where ALL women feel safe and supported (especially women of colour, trans women and survivors)
   <br><br>Ensure that womcam extends beyond Cambridge and is focused on other feminist activist work happening across the country
   <br><br> Create a campaign that simplifies feminist theory and encourages a welcoming where people can learn and their politics can grow.
   <br><br>The voting period takes place 7-10th March. Voting is open to women and non-binary people only.
